/*
Package storage implements the Cockroach storage node. A storage node
exports the "Node" Go RPC service. Each node handles one or more
stores, identified by a device name. Each store corresponds to a single
physical device. A store multiplexes to one or more ranges, identified
by start key. Ranges are contiguous regions of the keyspace. Each range
implements an instance of the raft consensus algorithm to synchronize
range replicas.

The Engine interface provides an API for key-value stores. InMem
implements an in-memory engine using a sorted map. RocksDB implements
an engine for data stored to local disk using RocksDB, a variant of
LevelDB.
